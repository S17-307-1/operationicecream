1. As a competitive player, I want an online leaderboard system so I can compare my scores against my friends.
2. As a serious gamer, I want to be able to customize my graphics settings so I can adjust how the game performs and looks.
3. As a creative person, I want a map-maker tool so I can make and share my own maps.
