1) As a gamer, I want to be able to see how much time I have left in each round of the game, so that I know when to finish the game by.
2) As a player, I want to be able to clearly see my enemies when they are on the screen, so that I know where to shoot.
3) As a player, I want to get a different experience each time I play the game, so that I will want to play it multiple times.
